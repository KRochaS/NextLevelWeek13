For the development of the application, various features of ReactJS were leveraged, such as componentization, properties, and common hooks like useEffect, useMemo, and useState. Additionally, Shadcn UI library components were integrated. Video-to-audio conversion was achieved using the FFmpeg library. For styling, Tailwind CSS was employed, offering the benefit of rapid and consistent UI development.
Furthermore, the backend API was seamlessly accessed using Axios, enhancing the application's functionality.
